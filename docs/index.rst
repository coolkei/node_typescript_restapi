Building RESTful Web APIs with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and TypeScript
===================================================================================================

This is a simple API that saves contact information of people.

There are two versions of this project.

`V1.0.0: <https://github.com/dalenguyen/rest-api-node-typescript/tree/v1.0.0>`_ you can run the server directly after cloning this version. It will create a simple RESTful API over HTTP.

`V2.0.0: <https://github.com/dalenguyen/rest-api-node-typescript/tree/v2.0.0>`_ this is a more secure and control API project. You need to read the post on how to secure RESTful API application first. After that, you can run the project.
